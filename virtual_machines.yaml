# Yaml configuration file for provisioning virtual machines on proxmox host
# Configuration file is loaded by python and VMs are created remotely over SSH on the proxmox host
resources:
  # For each virtual machine create a collection of specs
  # Set typical variables for VMs, hostname, cpu, mem, disk, etc.
  - virtual machine:
      # Hostname and display name of the VM
      hostname: test-vm-1 # REQUIRED #
      # Number of vcpus
      cpu: 2 # REQUIRED #
      # Amount of memory to be allocated to the VM (in GB)
      memory: 4 # REQUIRED #
      # Amount of disk space to be allocated to the VM (in GB)
      disk: 50 # REQUIRED #
      # Specify the operating system for the VM
      # Script will search for the closest iso file, so file name doesn't need to be exact
      # By default, the script will search for iso files on the local proxmox host
      # In directory /var/lib/vz/template/iso/
      operating system: windows server 2019
      # Specify the full path/command for the iso image
      # This should match what would typically be used in the qm create command
      # NOTE: No parsing or searching will be done on this, it will be directly used in the qm create command
      iso image path: local:iso/Windows_Server_2019.iso
